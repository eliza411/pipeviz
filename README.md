# Pipeviz

Pipeviz is a system for visualizing what you need to know as a software-driven organization: your development workflow, the state of your infrastructure, and more. It's a database, and visualization webapp rolled into one, informed by an ecosystem of agents and other message producers.

## Installation Options

Pipeviz requires that you either have a working Go 1.4 environment, or that you use the provided Dockerfiles to do it for you. There are three basic cases:

* Hacking on pipeviz (frontend or backend): local Go environment.
* Hacking on message producers: you can get away with Docker.
* Actually running pipeviz: Docker, or whatever your hosting environment dictates.

### Local Go: Server

Setting up a local Go environment oughtn't be too difficult. [These instructions](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/get_setup) should get you there. Make sure you set your `$GOPATH` and update your `$PATH` with the `$GOPATH/bin` directory, as it recommends! You'll also need Go 1.4, as the pipeviz build process relies on code generation via `go generate`, which was added to the toolchain in 1.4. Note that 

Once you have a working environment, you'll start by getting the package. Because pipeviz is currently a private repository, this can be little tricky. If you have a Github authentication token (for HTTPS cloning) already set up, then this will work:

```
go get github.com/tag1consulting/pipeviz
```

This is the standard method for fetching Go packages, and will work once the pipeviz repository is public. But if you don't have an HTTPS token set up, do this instead:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/tag1consulting
git clone git@github.com:tag1consulting/pipeviz $GOPATH/src/github.com/tag1consulting/pipeviz
```

This puts the repository in the same place as where `go get` would have dropped it. Whichever way you use, the next step is to `cd` into that directory and install:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tag1consulting/pipeviz
make install
```

This will install two binaries into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory: `pvutil`, and `pipeviz` itself.

You're done! You can just run `pipeviz` with no arguments, and it will bind (on loopback only) to port 8008 for the webapp, and 2309 for message ingestion.

### Local Go: Message producers

Pipeviz operates sort of like a log aggregation system: by receiving small bits of input (called “messages”) from a variety of sources. These sources are known collectively as “message producers.”

These are the message producers we currently have:

* `pvc` (PipeViz Cli) - a general-purpose, interactive command line tool for reporting information to pipeviz. Typically used by running it from the machine about which you want to report information.
* `pvgit` - a tool for instrumenting and reporting from (local, non-bare) git repositories. Instrumentation makes the repository report automatically as a developer goes about their daily work.

Running `make client-deps` should be sufficient to gather all necessary dependencies. `pvgit`, however, requires libgit2 v0.22; see the instructions from [git2go](https://github.com/libgit2/git2go#installing).

Each of the (Go-based) message producers is located in a subdirectory under `clients/cmd`. To build them, simply `cd` into the respective directory and run `go install`.

### Docker

We maintain both a Debian and a Fedora Dockerfile. Unless you're working on a platform-specific message producer, there's no compelling reason to choose one over another.

To set up Docker, see the [Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/) link on https://docs.docker.com. Be sure to choose the directions for your operating system.

Each Pipeviz Dockerfile contains the commands you need in the comments at the top of the file.
