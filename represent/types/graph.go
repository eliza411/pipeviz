/*
CoreGraph is the interface provided by pipeviz' main graph object.

It is a persistent/immutable datastructure: only the Merge() method is able
to change the graph, but that method returns a pointer to a new graph rather
than updating in-place. (These copies typically share structure for efficiency)

All other methods are read-only, and generally provide composable parts that
work together to facilitate the creation of larger traversals/queries.
